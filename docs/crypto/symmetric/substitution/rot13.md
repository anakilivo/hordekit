# ROT13 Cipher

## History

ROT13 (rotate by 13 places) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. It was commonly used in early Usenet newsgroups and online forums to hide spoilers, punchlines, and potentially offensive content.

The name "ROT13" comes from the fact that it rotates each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet. Since the English alphabet has 26 letters, applying ROT13 twice returns the original text, making it its own inverse.

## Concept

ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter by exactly 13 positions in the alphabet.

**Mathematical Representation:**
- For any letter: `E(x) = (x + 13) mod 26`
- Where `x` is the position of the letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)

**Important Note:** ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher where `shift = 13`. The transformation can be written as: `E(x) = (x + 13) mod 26`

## Encryption Process

1. **Alphabet Mapping:**
   ```
   A → N, B → O, C → P, D → Q, E → R, F → S, G → T, H → U, I → V, J → W, K → X, L → Y, M → Z
   N → A, O → B, P → C, Q → D, R → E, S → F, T → G, U → H, V → I, W → J, X → K, Y → L, Z → M
   ```

2. **Example:**
   ```
   Plaintext:  "ROT13 CIPHER"
   Encrypted:  "EBG13 PVCURE"
   
   R → E, O → B, T → G, 1 → 1, 3 → 3
   C → P, I → V, P → C, H → U, E → R, R → E
   ```

## Decryption Process

Since ROT13 is its own inverse, the decryption process is identical to encryption:

```
Ciphertext: "EBG13 PVCURE"
Decrypted:  "ROT13 CIPHER"
```

## Relationship to Caesar Cipher

ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher with parameter `shift = 13`:

- **Caesar transformation:** `E(x) = (x + shift) mod 26`
- **ROT13 transformation:** `E(x) = (x + 13) mod 26`

This means that ROT13 inherits all the mathematical properties of the Caesar cipher while being constrained to a specific parameter set.

## No Attack Methods

ROT13 has no meaningful attack methods because it has no variability - it's a fixed algorithm without a key. The transformation is deterministic and known:

- **No Key Space:** Only one possible configuration
- **No Brute Force:** Only one transformation to try
- **No Frequency Analysis:** The transformation is fixed and known
- **No Known Plaintext:** Any known plaintext immediately reveals the algorithm

Any attempt to "attack" ROT13 would simply be applying the transformation to see if it produces meaningful text, which is not a cryptographic attack in the traditional sense.

## Security Analysis

### Strengths
- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement and understand
- **Deterministic:** Same input always produces same output
- **Self-inverse:** Same operation for encryption and decryption
- **Mathematical Foundation:** Based on well-understood Caesar cipher

### Weaknesses
- **No Key:** Only one possible configuration
- **Predictable:** Easy to break with any attack method
- **Pattern Preservation:** Letter frequencies and patterns remain recognizable
- **Trivial Brute Force:** Only one transformation to try
- **No Variability:** Fixed algorithm without any key space

### Security Level: **Very Low**

ROT13 provides no real security and should only be used for educational purposes or as a component in more complex ciphers.

**Note:** ROT13 has no attack methods because it has no variability - it's a fixed algorithm without a key. Any attempt to "attack" ROT13 would simply be applying the transformation to see if it produces meaningful text, which is not a cryptographic attack in the traditional sense.

## Implementation Notes

### Key Features
- **Case Preservation:** Maintains original case of letters
- **Non-alphabetic Handling:** Preserves numbers, punctuation, and spaces
- **Efficient Translation:** Uses `str.translate()` for fast character mapping
- **Self-inverse:** Same method for encryption and decryption
- **Inheritance:** Inherits from CaesarCipher class for code reuse
- **No Attack Methods:** No variability means no meaningful attack methods

### Performance
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the text
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - fixed translation tables
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal - only translation tables

## Real-World Applications

### Historical Uses
- **Usenet Newsgroups:** Hiding spoilers and offensive content
- **Online Forums:** Simple text obfuscation
- **Educational:** Teaching basic cryptography concepts
- **Programming:** Simple text transformation in code

### Modern Uses
- **Educational:** Learning substitution ciphers
- **Puzzles:** Simple encoding for games and puzzles
- **CTF Challenges:** Basic cryptography challenges
- **Component Ciphers:** Building block for more complex systems

## Code Example

```python
from hordekit.crypto.symmetric.substitution.rot13 import ROT13Cipher

# Create ROT13 cipher instance
rot13 = ROT13Cipher()

# Encrypt a message
message = "ROT13 CIPHER"
encrypted = rot13.encode(message)
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted}")  # Output: EBG13 PVCURE

# Decrypt the message
decrypted = rot13.decode(encrypted)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")  # Output: ROT13 CIPHER

# Verify symmetry
twice_encrypted = rot13.encode(encrypted)
print(f"Symmetry: {message == twice_encrypted}")  # Output: True

# Demonstrate inheritance from CaesarCipher
print(f"Is instance of CaesarCipher: {isinstance(rot13, CaesarCipher)}")  # Output: True

# Show that there are no attack methods
print(f"Attack methods: {ROT13Cipher.SUPPORTED_ATTACK_METHODS}")  # Output: []
```
